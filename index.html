            I am a software developer living in southern Ohio. I first wandered into the 
            wide world of Computer Science in High School. Back then, I just wanted to
            make my own games. Through High School I made a couple (very) simple Java
            games, which led to me getting a degree in Computer Science from Cedarville
            University. I currently work in C++. Yet, since QML uses Javascript, and I 
            work mostly in the frontend, I still write Javascript professionally. I 
            really like working on web and mobile applications, since it allows me to 
            express some creativity. Ultimately I see programming as a way to serve other
            people, and so I feel most energized in my work when I can help make someone's
            life easier.

            On this site you'll find an introduction to the skills I have to offer. This 
            site itself is intended to be a small sampling of my work, as I have done my
            best to make this site mobile friendly. Thank you for visiting!

              I first encountered responsive web design when I worked on a hackathon team to develop
              a website that required mobile support. Our team decided not to use any CSS frameworks
              such as Bootstrap. So, we ended up writing a fully responsive 
              <a href="https://unreachedoftheday.org/index.php" target="_blank">website</a> using 
              only PHP and CSS.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-text">
              The hackathon equipped me well for my next work experience. A year and a half later, I
              worked for EduSource, a small software company that developed web applications. There I 
              worked on two different web projects that also required support for multiple devices.

              The first time I programmed in Javascript I was in High School using Khan Academy's programming
              lessons. Back then I still thought Java and Javascript were related. I've learned a lot since 
              then.

            <p class="paragraph-text">
              When I worked for EduSource, I worked on AngularJS applications. During my time there, we decided
              to move to Typescript. It was also through EduSource that I learned about React, and I spent some
              time learning how to use it in my free time. Though I currently work in C++, I still use Javascript
              professionally. My team uses QML, which implements the ECMA standard.

              At my current position, our project is entirely C++. Since I started working in C++, I 
              have learned countless things about the language. I'm still learning. C++ is huge.

              During my time at EduSource, I also worked in C#. While I was there I gained familiarity
              with the .NET framework and writing endpoints for RESTful APIs.

              I have used lots of different languages in various capacities. I've written Python scripts 
              professionally, played around with Haskell and Scheme, written small games in Java, and
              written SQL queries.

              I have never developed for Android in a professional environment. But, during my last
              year at Cedarville, my senior design team worked to update an existing Android 
              application. The old app (called StoryProducer) allowed a user to create slide show 
              videos, with translated audio over the pictures. My senior design team updated 
              StoryProducer to create FilmProducer. FilmProducer could not only create slide show
              videos, it also allowed the user to record translations and place them over videos, 
              too.

          <p class="paragraph-text">
            My wife, Alison, and I have both always loved old-timey things. We also love to play
            music. She plays the piano and sings (quite well), and I play the fiddle. I like to 
            draw, sculpt, needle felt, sometimes paint, and have too many hobbies. I also really 
            enjoy reading books. Sometimes I get a really thick, academic tome out from the 
            library, and other times I finish the books I start reading.
